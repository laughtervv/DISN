Software - Supported Compilers

    Intel(R) C++ Compiler 16, 17 and 18 version
        Note: Using Intel C++ Compiler 18.0 might result
        in better performance for many of Parallel STL algorithms,
        comparing to previous compiler versions.
    Microsoft* Visual C++ 14.0 (Microsoft* Visual Studio* 2015,
        Windows* OS only)
    Microsoft* Visual C++ 14.1 (Microsoft* Visual Studio* 2017,
        Windows* OS only)
    Microsoft* Windows* Software Development Kit for Windows* 10
    For each supported Linux* operating system, the standard gcc
        version provided with that operating system is supported
            GNU Compilers (gcc) 4.8 - 7.1
    Clang* 3.3 - 3.8
    Xcode* 6.3 - 9.1
    Android* NDK r13 - r16

Known Issues or limitations

    unseq and par_unseq policies only have effect with compilers that
        support '#pragma omp simd' or '#pragma simd'
    Parallel and vector execution is only supported for a subset of
        algorithms if random access iterators are provided, while for
        the rest execution will remain serial.
    Depending on a compiler, zip_iterator may not work with
        unseq and par_unseq policies.
